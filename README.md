**Note: If you're using this GitHub Action on a private repository you must [purchase a license](https://gum.co/MvvBE).**

Alternatively you may also want to consider using the [Typo CI GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/typo-ci/).

## Installation

Copy add the following to `.github/workflows/spellcheck.yml`:

```yml
# Add to: .github/workflows/spellcheck.yml
name: Typo CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
jobs:
  spellcheck:
    name: Typo CI (GitHub Action)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 4
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[ci skip]')"
    steps:
    - name: TypoCheck
      uses: typoci/spellcheck-action@master
      # with:
        # A license can be purchased via:
        # https://gumroad.com/l/MvvBE
        # typo_ci_license_key: ${{ secrets.TYPO_CI_LICENSE_KEY }}
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Configuration

You can tweak how Typo CI analyses your code by adding a `.typo-ci.yml` file to the root of your repository. Here is a sample file:

```yml
# This is a sample .typo-ci.yml file, it's used to configure how Typo CI will behave.
# Add it to the root of your project and push it to github.
---

# What language dictionaries should it use? Currently Typo CI supports:
# de
# en
# en_GB
# es
# fr
# it
# pt
# pt_BR
# tr
dictionaries:
  - en
  - en_GB

# Any files/folders we should ignore?
excluded_files:
  - "vendor/**/*"
  - "node_modules/**/*"
  - "*.key"
  - "*.enc"
  - "*.min.css"
  - "*.css.map"
  - "*.min.js"
  - "*.js.map"
  - "*.mk"
  - "package-lock.json"
  - "yarn.lock"
  - "Gemfile.lock"
  - ".typo-ci.yml"

# Any typos we should ignore?
excluded_words:
  - typoci

# Would you like filenames to also be spellchecked?
spellcheck_filenames: true
```

## The Prosperity Public License 3.0.0

This is free for open source, but if you're using it on a private repo then your are required to purchase a license key.

You can purchase a license via [Gumroad](https://gum.co/MvvBE) for $15 (excluding taxes). It helps support the ongoing development and every purchase is very appreciated.

## Dictionaries

### Development Languages

To help the spell checker detect words that are valid in the programming world, I've created a collection of language specific dictionaries which are stored in [db/dict/contextual](https://github.com/TypoCI/spellcheck-action/tree/master/db/dict/contextual).

These are pragmatically generated by analysing open source projects.

### Spoken Language Dictionaries

The `en`, `en_GB` & `pt_BR` dictionaries were built from [https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist](https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist) and they are stored in [db/dict/imported](https://github.com/TypoCI/spellcheck-action/tree/master/db/dict/imported).

Other languages have been imported via NPM from [wooorm/dictionaries](https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries).
