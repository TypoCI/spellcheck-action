## The Prosperity Public License 3.0.0

This is free for open source, but if you're using it on a private repo then your are required to purchase a license key after 30 days of usage.

You can purchase a license via [Gumroad](https://gum.co/MvvBE) for $15 (excluding taxes). It helps support the ongoing development and every purchase is very appreciated.

## Dictionaries

### Development Languages

To help the spell checker detect words that are valid in the programming world, I've created a collection of language specific dictionaries which are stored in [db/dict/contextual](https://github.com/TypoCI/spellcheck-action/tree/master/db/dict/contextual).

These are pragmatically generated by analysing open source projects.

### Spoken Language Dictionaries

The `en`, `en_GB` & `pt_BR` dictionaries were built from https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist they are stored in [db/dict/imported/en_GB.aff](https://github.com/TypoCI/spellcheck-action/tree/master/db/dict/imported).

Other languages have been imported via Yarn from [wooorm/dictionaries](https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries).
